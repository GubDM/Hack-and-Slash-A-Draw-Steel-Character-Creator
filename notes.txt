=== TO-DO ======


========================================
==== KNOWN THINGS UNIMPLEMENTED ========
========================================

* "Special" distance abilities with Area keyword do not include kit bonuses to the area/distance (e.g. from Frigid)
	(because I have no idea how that would work in a robust way, and I see no relevant examples in the rules right now)

* Don't know how psionic kit bonuses work yet, whether Magic Area/Distance applies also to Psionic, or if they	
	have their own keyword. So right now, I'm not printing psionic-keyworded ability distances at all

* All of the "X wall" instances in the backer kit are in the Effect of abilities, not the Distance, and the
	abilities that do have it don't have the Area keyword. So, for example, taking the Frigid kit does not increase your
	5 wall of stone as part of the Creation effect of Prayer to a 6 wall.
	
	Similarly, Alertness Ward and Compassionate Aura both have "aura" in their effect, but only Alertness Ward
	has a distance associated with it (within 2), but neither has any Keyword at all, or Distance header for the ability.
	I'm not implementing the magic area bonus from the frigid kit onto these effects.

* In the current implementation, if an ability does *not* have the Area keyword, then Distances that are associated with
	the Area keyword (i.e. 'cube', 'burst', 'aura', 'wall', 'line') will not print.
	"Distance: burst 5" with no Area keyword will just print as "Distance: -"

* Would like to one day implement more robust data checking on load. Want users making their own json files to
	have detailed reports when there's an issue in their data. Not have to guess and check, and certainly not
	have to look into the code and put print statements all over the place.
	In fact, would like to print errors to a debug log so even users who just have the .exe can see the errors.

* Conduit's Divine Weakness is in the Backer Packet only listed as having corruption damage at Tier 1. Tiers 2 and 3 only
	do untyped damage. This might be a typo, but I've implemented it as it's written.
