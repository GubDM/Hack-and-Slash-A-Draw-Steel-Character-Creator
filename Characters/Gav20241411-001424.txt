Kit: Cloak and Dagger
      > You wear light armor and wield one or two light weapons.
 
Heroic Resource: Insight
      > By observing your enemy, you learn how to use their weaknesses against them. You
	have a Heroic Resource called insight.
	  Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked in turns and rounds,
	you have insight equal to your Victories. If you lose some or all of this
	insight outside of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it.
	  When a combat encounter begins, you keep any insight you had outside of combat.
	At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 insight. You gain
	1 insight whenever you get a tier 3 result with an attack. When combat ends,
	you once again have insight equal to your Victories.
