Kits: Cloak and Dagger, Martial Artist
      > You wear light armor or no armor and wield one or two light
        weapons or only your unarmed strikes.
 
Heroic Resource: Focus
      > The ring of steel panics others but brings order to your mind, granting you a
	Heroic Resource called focus.
	  Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked in turns and rounds,
	you have focus equal to your Victories. If you lose some or all of this focus
	outside of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it.
	  When a combat encounter begins, you keep any focus you had outside of combat. At
	the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 focus. If an ally
	gets a tier 3 result on an attack against a target you have marked, you gain 1
	focus. When combat ends, you once again have focus equal to your Victories.

[Feature] Doomsight
      > Working with your Director, you can predetermine an encounter in which you will
	die. When that encounter begins, you become doomed. While doomed, you lose the
	Undaunted benefit from this ancestry, you automatically get tier 3 results on
	tests and resistance rolls, and you don't die no matter how low your Stamina
	falls. You then die immediately at the end of the encounter.
	  If you don't predetermine your death encounter, you can choose to become doomed
	while you are dying with the director's approval (no action required). Doing so
	should be reserved for encounters in which you are dying as a result of
	suitable heroism, such as making a last stand against a boss or saving
	civilians, or when the consequences of your actions have finally caught up to
	you - not because you're playing a one-shot and have nothing to lose, Hacaarl.

[Feature] Undaunted
      > You can't be weakened. Additionally, when your Stamina equals the negative of
	your winded value, you turn to rubble instead of dying. You are unaware of your
	surroundings in this state. After 12 hours, you regain Stamina equal to your
	recovery value.

	skill you have from the crafting skill group, you can roll the test twice and
	use either roll.

[Feature] Field Arsenal
      > You have drilled with a broad array of weapons and have developed techniques to
	optimize their use. Whenever you select or change your kit, you can select an
	additional martial kit and gain the benefits of both kits.

[Feature] Imposing Attitude
      > While you are present, each hero with you is treated as having a Renown 2 higher
	than usual for the purpose of negotiations and influencing tests. Additionally,
	each hero with you has a double edge on tests made to stop combat and start a
	negotiation with the other side.
