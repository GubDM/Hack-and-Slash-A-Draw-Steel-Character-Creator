Kit: Stormwight: Corven
      > You wear no armor and wield only your unarmed strikes - which
        become devastating natural weapons as your rage grows.
 
Heroic Resource: Rage
      > As the battle intensifies around you, your determination and anger grow, fueling
	a Heroic Resource called rage.
	  Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked in turns and rounds,
	you have fury equal to your Victories. If you lose some or all of this rage
	outside of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it.
	  When a combat encounter begins, you keep any rage you had outside of combat. At
	the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 rage. When combat
	ends, you once again have rage equal to your Victories.
