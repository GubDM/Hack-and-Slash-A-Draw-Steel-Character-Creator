Kit: Martial Artist
      > You wear no armor and wield only your unarmed strikes.
 
Heroic Resource: Piety
      > Your deity grants you a Heroic Resource called piety to fuel your abilities. You
	use piety to heal and empower your allies, and to unleash your deity's power
	upon your foes.
	  Outside of combat and other dangerous situations tracked in turns and rounds,
	you have piety equal to your Victories. If you lose some or all of this piety
	outside of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it.
	  When a combat encounter begins, you keep any piety you had outside of combat. At
	the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 piety. You can also
	use the Prayer ability to gain additional piety. When combat ends, you once
	again have piety equal to your Victories.
