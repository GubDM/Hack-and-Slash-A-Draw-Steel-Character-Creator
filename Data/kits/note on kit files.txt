When you implement a kit data file, make sure you remove
the kit bonuses from the signature action.

For example: in the rules, Guisarmier's signature action has:
	* reach 2
	* damage 4/6/8

But the kit provides bonuses:
	* reach +1
	* melee damage +2/+2/+2

So in the data file, the signature action should be written with:
	* reach 1
	* damage 2/4/6
