You then die immediately at the end of the encounter.{N}If you don't predetermine your death encounter, you can choose to become doomed while you are dying with the director's approval (no action required). Doing so should be reserved for encounters in which you are dying as a result of suitable heroism, such as making a last stand against a boss or saving civilians, or when the consequences of your actions have finally caught up to you - not because you're playing a one-shot and have nothing to lose, Hacaarl.
